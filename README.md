### Practical titles
#### Practical 1 -  Python program to manage the borrowing records of books in a library
#### Practical 2 - In an e-commerce system, customer account IDs are stored in a list, and you are tasked with writing a program that implements Linear and Binary Search
#### Practical 3 - In a company, employee salaries are stored in a list as floating-point numbers. Write a Python program that sorts the employee salaries in ascending order using 1.Linear Search , 2. Binary Search
#### Practical 4 - Implementing a real-time undo/redo system for a text editing application using a Stack data structure.
#### Practical 5 - Implement a real-time event processing system using a Queue data structure. The system should support features: add an event , process next event , display pending events , cancel an event.
#### Practical 6 - A call center receives incoming calls, and each call is assigned a unique customer ID. The calls are answered in the order they are received. Your task is to simulate the call queue of a call center using a queue data structure: addCall(id , time) , answerCall() , viewQueue() , isQueueEmpty()
#### Practical 7 - Create a Student Record Management System using linked list
- Use a singly/doubly linked list to store student data (Roll No, Name, Marks).
- Perform operations: Add, Delete, Update, Search, and Sort.
- Display records in ascending/descending order based on marks or roll number.
#### Practical 8 - Implement a hash table of size 10 and use the division method as a hash function. In case of a collision, use chaining. Implement the following operations: Insert , search , delete.
#### Practical 9 - Design and implement a hash table of fixed size. Use the division method for the hash function and resolve collisions using linear probing. Allow the user to perform the following operations: Insert , search , delete a key , display table.
#### Practical 10 - Implement a hash table with extendible hashing. The hash table should dynamically expand when the number of keys in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold. Perform the following operations: Insert , Search , Delete.
